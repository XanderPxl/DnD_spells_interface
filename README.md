The aim of this project is to create a program where you can look through the different spells and cast them as a character
from the level of your choice. Used spells will of course be removed from the list and added to a sepperate file that contains 
the history of the used spells.

The project is still in development and is part of the exam of C Programming 2 from PXL-digital.
This means that it won't be perfect or without any bugs.
