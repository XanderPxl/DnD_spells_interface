The aim of this project is to create a program where you can look through the different spells and cast them as a character
of the level that you choose. Used spells will ofcourse be removed of the list. The history of these used spells will also be 
stored in a seperate file.

The project is still in development and is being made as part of the exam of C Programming 2 from PXL-digital.
This means that it won't be perfect or without any bugs.
