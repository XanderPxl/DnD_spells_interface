This program functions as a framework and a proof of concept that partialy simulates a deck of DnD spell cards. You can add, delete and go through the deck of cards.

The project won't be further developed and was the C Programming 2 thesis in the first year of college in PXL-Digital.
This means that it won't be perfect or without any bugs.
